    "# Tutorial 1: Training and Evaluation of Logistic Regression on Encrypted Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this first use case tutorial, where we are going to show how to use TenSEAL for training and evaluating a logistic regression (LR) model on encrypted data (using homomorphic encryption) for heart disease prediction! If you haven't played with TenSEAL before, I would suggest going through ['Tutorial 0 - Getting Started'](./Tutorial%200%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb) first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** The goal of this tutorial isn't to show how efficient LR is for this task, we will just go with whatever accuracy we get, but the training and evaluation on encrypted data should be comparable to when we use plain data.\n",
