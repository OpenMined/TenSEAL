    "#### The scaling factor\n",
    "The first step of the CKKS scheme is encoding a vector of real numbers into a plaintext polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaling factor defines the encoding precision for the binary representation of the number. Intuitively, we are talking about binary precision as pictured below:\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/floating_point.png\" alt=\"ckks-high-level\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The polynomial modulus degree(poly_modulus_degree)\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial modulus($N$ in the diagram) directly affects:\n",
    " - The number of coefficients in plaintext polynomials\n",
    " - The size of ciphertext elements\n",
    " - The computational performance of the scheme (bigger is worse)\n",
    " - The security level (bigger is better).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TenSEAL, as in Microsoft SEAL the degree of the polynomial modulus must be a power of 2 (e.g. $1024$, $2048$, $4096$, $8192$, $16384$, or $32768$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The coefficient modulus sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "The last parameter required for the scheme is a list of binary sizes.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### The public encryption key\n",
    "The key is used for encryption in the public key encryption setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The relinearization keys\n",
    "Every new ciphertext has a size of 2, and multiplying ciphertexts of sizes $K$ and $L$ results in a ciphertext of size $K+L-1$. Unfortunately, this growth in size slows down further multiplications and increases noise growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relinearization is the operation that reduces the size of ciphertexts back to 2. This operation requires another type of public keys, the relinearization keys created by the secret key owner. \n",

    "Galois keys are another type of public keys needed to perform encrypted vector rotation operations on batched ciphertexts. \n",

    "The operation is executed automatically by TenSEAL after each encrypted or plain multiplication.\n",
    "\n",

    "To overcome this problem, most HE schemes usually use a modulus-switching technique. In the case of CKKS, the modulus-switching procedure is called rescaling. Applying the rescaling algorithm after a homomomorphic multiplication, the approximation error grows linearly, not exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a ciphertext encrypted modulo $q_1...q_k$, this function switches the modulus down to $q_1...q_{k-1}$,      scales the message down accordingly.\n",
