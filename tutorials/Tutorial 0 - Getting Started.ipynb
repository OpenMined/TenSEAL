    "\n",
    "Welcome to TenSEAL's first tutorial of a serie aiming at introducing homomorphic encryption and the capabilities of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "TenSEAL is a library for doing homomorphic encryption operations on tensors. It's built on top of [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL), a C++ library implementing the BFV and CKKS homomorphic encryption schemes. TenSEAL provides ease of use through a Python API, while preserving efficiency by implementing most of its operations using C++, so TenSEAL is a C++ library that have a Python interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now start the tutorial with a brief review of what homomorphic encryption is, but keep in mind that you don't need to be a crypto expert to use the library.\n",

    "## Homomorphic Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition__ : Homomorphic encription (HE) is an encryption technique that allows computations to be made on ciphertexts and generates results that when decrypted, corresponds to the result of the same computations made on plaintexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "![he-black-box](assets/he-black-box.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that an HE scheme lets you encrypt two numbers *X* and *Y*, add their encrypted versions so that it gets decrypted to *X + Y*, the addition could have been a multiplication as well. If we translate this to python, it may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 7\n",
    "y = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "x_encrypted = HE.encrypt(x)\n",
    "y_encrypted = HE.encrypt(y)\n",
    "\n",
    "z_encrypted = x_encrypted + y_encrypted\n",
    "\n",
    "# z should now be x + y = 10\n",
    "z = HE.decrypt(z_encrypted)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many details are hidden in this python script, things like key generation doesn't appear, and that `+` operation over encrypted numbers isn't the usual `+` over integers, but a special evaluation algorithm that can evaluate addition over encrypted numbers. TenSEAL supports addition, substraction and multiplication of encrypted vectors of either integers (using BFV) or real numbers (using CKKS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will look at the most important object of the library, the TenSEALContext."

Basically, you will want to create a single TenSEALContext before doing your encrypted computation. Let's see how to create one !"
